## Printing on the Console
A good start is learning how to print, if you want to know something happens, print it on the console!
```lua
print("Hello World")
```
###### Print, but separated.
So, you want to separate them? Alright!
```lua
print("Hello"..."World!")
```
###### Print random numbers
```lua
print(math.random(0, 100))
```
###### Print text with random numbers
What if you want to print... uhhh, Text with random numbers!
```lua
print("Hi world, I wanted to give you a number: " math.random(0, 100))
```
